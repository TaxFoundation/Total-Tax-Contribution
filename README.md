# Taxing Powerhouses: The Crucial Role of Businesses in Sustaining Government Revenue

The Tax Foundation’s publication Taxing Powerhouses: The Crucial Role of Businesses in Sustaining Government Revenue shows how businesses contribute to government revenue through the taxes they are legally liable to pay and the taxes they are required to collect and remit on behalf of others.

Note:
(1)	This paper characterizes the tax revenue collected in the form of withholding taxes on labor and capital income as businesses’ legal remittance responsibility.
(2)	Insurance premiums, banking services, gambling and betting stakes, transport, entertainment, restaurant, and advertising charges. Taxes levied on the gross income of companies providing a specific service (transportation, insurance, banking, entertainment, restaurants, and advertising).
(3)	Business and professional licenses paid by enterprises in order to obtain a license to carry on a particular kind of business or profession when the levies are on a recurring basis. While there might be some licenses that are not paid directly by the professionals and companies, the amount is considered negligible. Therefore, 5213 is fully considered a business legal remittance.
(4)	Taxes levied on the emission or discharge into the environment of noxious gases, liquids, or other harmful substances. Also, once-and-for-all payments for permission to sell liquor or tobacco or to set up betting shops are included here.
