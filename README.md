Taxing Powerhouses: The Crucial Role of Businesses in Sustaining Government Revenue
The Tax Foundation’s publication Taxing Powerhouses: The Crucial Role of Businesses in Sustaining Government Revenue shows how businesses contribute to government revenue through the taxes they are legally liable to pay and the taxes they are required to collect and remit on behalf of others.
The Dataset
All the revenue data used in this publication comes from the OECD's Revenue Statistics Database (https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=RS_GBL) and Revenue Statistics – OECD countries: comparative tables (https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=RevGlobal). The dataset includes annual revenue data for almost 100 countries worldwide, dating to 1965 for many OECD countries and 1990 for a number of non-OECD countries. As of February 2021, the most recent data is 2019 for OECD countries and 2018 for non-OECD countries.

Details regarding the OECD dataset can be found in Annex A of the “Revenue Statistics 2020,” https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/8625f8e5-en/1/4/1/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/8625f8e5-en&_csp_=10eecbf76519867b3d14d98d90e8aff0&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book#.
